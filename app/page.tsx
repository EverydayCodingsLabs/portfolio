				<h2>What Makes Me Different</h2>
				<p>
					I'm not just another developer. I take full ownership of every project
					I work on, which can be seen in my startup. I approach problems with
					both a technical and business mindset—I understand that great code
					means nothing if it doesn't solve real problems.
				</p>
				<p>
					While I embrace AI-assisted development, I do it differently. I
					leverage AI to build powerful systems faster, but always with proper
					supervision, code review, and architectural oversight. This allows me
					to maintain quality while maximizing productivity—the best of both
					worlds.
